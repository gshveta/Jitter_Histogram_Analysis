# Jitter_Histogram_Analysis
This code taked the waveform data in the form of a .csv file and computes the cycle -cycle jitter from the data
This is done by identifying the zero crossings of thw waveform, identifying the cycles and then computing the cyc-cyc variation
A histogram is plotted at the end for the cyc-cyc jitter and its statistics like mean, median, std_dev are also computed
There are multiple print statments in the intermediate steps for debugging help
